For our P3 Milestone 2, we improved the climbing animation using the feedback we got from
the last playtesting session. We also added the ability for the player to jump off the 
ladder using space. We also removed the flashlight sprite and improved the menu and game clear
screens thanks to the feedback we received. Furthermore, we improved the mining animation to be
more controllable by the player, which also serves to accomodate for the new minable tile block 
feature we added in our milestone 2. We changed the controls for digging to be the left mouse button, 
which was reported as being more natural for players during our last playtesting session. As for player
guidance and interaction, we created short dialogue lines to better inform players what objective 
they are supposed to accomplish. Lastly, we changed the recharging stations or generators to be automatically
charging the player's flashlight when they come into range instead of prompting them.
