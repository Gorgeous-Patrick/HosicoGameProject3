For our P3 Milestone, we used the advice from the first playtesting session
to make the game more engaging and more fitting to the theme of mining. We decided
to rework the game into 2D since our gold spike was more of a 2D game with extra steps.
We also decided to use mining related assets and environment to conform better to the
theme we chose. We also added a pickaxe and animation to it in response to the fact that 
our gold spike lacked such feedback and to add novelty to the game. Finally, we 
implemented our levels and integrated the flashlight idea from our gold spike to allow 
for interesting player decisions.
