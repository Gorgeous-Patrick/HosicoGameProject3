This week, we redesigned parts of our map. The old map did not have a perfect guidance to the players and sometimes confuses them. So to make the purpose of the game clearer, we tweaked some parts of the map. In the play test session, we noticed that our game needs more juice. So we decided to add some basic audio effect so to the game in order to the game less dull and more joyful to play.
